        	<p>Quality education is something everyone needs in their lives. Afterall, how else are we supposed to discover the world? Despite this, many children still suffer in the hands of poverty, leading to inaccessible quality education. The right to education is not only the right to access education but also the right to receive an education of good quality. Education must be available and accessible but also acceptable and adaptable. </p>

                    		<h3>Why Quality Education Matters</h3>
                    		<p>Learning is a right, not a privilige. Quality education equips children like myself with knowledge and skills important for personal development. It provides us with equal opportunities regardless of our background or socioeconomic status. This ensures that every child gets the chance to learn and in return, teach this acquired knowledge to fellow children.</p>
